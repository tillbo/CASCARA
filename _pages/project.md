# Welcome to the project page for CASCARA

*CASCARA* stands for Un**C**overing **A**nd under**S**tanding differen**C**es in he**A**lth behaviou**R**s in people with di**A**betes. Cascara also is Spanish for shell, hence you may also understand this project as trying to break the shell that surrounds the mechanisms of behaviour change in people with diabetes. The goal is to use available data sources and the tools of econometrics and data science to uncover some of the mechanisms that underlie health behaviour change (or the lack thereof) in people with diabetes. A particular focus of *CASCARA* are thereby socio-economic factors that influence if and how people change their behaviours.

CASCARA is funded through a [Horizon 2020 Widening Fellowship](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101038046/).

This page will be used to provide updates about the project, including its publications and presentations.
